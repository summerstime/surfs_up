# Surfs Up üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
This project is to satisfy Module 9 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. The tasks for this challenge include the analysis of temperatures in Hawaii (Oahu, specifically) and
determining if the surf shop business should move forward. W. Avy is the investor who has prior experience with opening surf shops in Hawaii. However, his prior experience
what not positive, since he did not perform analysis on the weather. Included in this surf shop business idea is serving of ice cream.
With data that W. Avy has provided for Oahu, an analysis was performed. The results are shown below with a summary of other aspects that could be investigated before signing on to move forward.

### Results - Months of June and December across multiple years (Fahrenheit)
* üòé June Data - Total data points (1700)
* June data shows that the average temperature is about 75 degrees, with the coolest temps being around 64 degrees. The highest temperature points were about 85 degrees.
  * Average temp = 75
  * Coolest temp = 64
  * Highest temp = 85

* ‚òÄÔ∏è December Data - Total data points (1517)
* December data shows about 71 degrees is the average temp. The minimum is a brisk 56 degrees and a pleasent 83 degrees for a high.
  * Average temp = 71
  * Coolest temp = 56
  * Highest temp = 83

## Summary
Comparing the two months of June and December has shown that the average temperature appears to be similar, even though the lows of 64 and 56 are a bit different. With that, the idea of selling ice cream in the hotter months
may lend itself to also selling hot chocolate or coffee on those colder days. A surf and coffee bar, might be the solution for the colder days when not as many people would be surfing; but want a place to hangout.

As for precipitation, both months show a very low amount. December has a few more days; but overall it shows clear skies. :sun_with_face:

In the reference charts below, you can see the charts of each month's analysis and also the statistical descriptions. The temperatures clearly shift a little cooler in December; but it is not a drastic change.
