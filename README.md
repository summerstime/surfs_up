# Surfs Up 🏄‍♂️ 🏄‍♀️
Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
This project is to satisfy Module 9 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. The tasks for this challenge include the analysis of temperatures in Hawaii (Oahu, specifically) and
determining if the surf shop business should move forward. W. Avy is the investor who has prior experience with opening surf shops in Hawaii. However, his prior experience
what not positive, since he did not perform analysis on the weather.
With data that W. Avy has provided for Oahu, an analysis was performed. The results are shown below with a summary of other aspects that could be investigated before signing on to move forward.
